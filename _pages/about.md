Hi! I am a PhD Student at **[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/)** and **[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)** supervised by **[Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/)** and **[Lars Grant](https://www.ladydavis.ca/en/researcher/lars-grant/)**. I previously completed a BSc at **[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)**, for which I received the **[First-Class Honours distinction](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/university_regulations_and_resources/undergraduate/gi_graduation_honours)** and the **[Dean’s Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research List Distinction](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/university_regulations_and_resources/undergraduate/gi_graduation_honours)**, during which I completed 5 research internships working with **[Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/)**, **[David Juncker](https://juncker.lab.mcgill.ca/david-juncker)**, **[Gabriel Venne](https://www.mcgill.ca/ihse/about-us/who-we-are/associate-members/gabriel-venne)** and **[Peter Metrakos](https://rimuhc.ca/fr/-/peter-metrakos-md)**.

My two main research goals are:
- Improving how intelligent __agents__ learn and __make decisions__ in __complex environments__, especially when those environments involve __many possible actions__ and __sparse rewards__.
- Applying __AI__ to support __healthcare__ workers and patients in their decision making to __promote safety__, __robustness__ in __uncertain contexts__, and efficiency in __data-constrained environments__.

I am a recipient of the:
- **[Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Santé (FRQS) Scholarship](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/health/)**
- **[Schull-Yang International Experience Award](https://www.mcgill.ca/iea/article/flemming-kondrup-bsc-anatomy-and-cell-biology-miea-ambassador-2021)**
- **[McGill Quantitative Life Science Stipend Award](https://www.mcgill.ca/qls/program-info)**

In 2022, I was captain of McGill's team in **[Project X](https://www.uoft.ai/projectx)**, an AI research competition organized by the University of Toronto with competitors from top academic institutions across North America. Our **[work](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.26862)** on Deep Conservative Reinforcement Learning for Mechanical Ventilation received the highest score out of all 25 papers submitted, winning the competition with a $25,000 award, and leading to press interviews with **[The Tribune](https://www.thetribune.ca/sci-tech/six-mcgill-undergrads-win-uoft-international-artificial-intelligence-competition-03152022/)** and **[The McGill Reporter](https://reporter.mcgill.ca/undergrad-team-uses-machine-learning-to-create-a-better-hospital-ventilator/)**.
