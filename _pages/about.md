Hi! I am a PhD Student at **[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/)** and **[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)** supervised by **[Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/)** and **[Lars Grant](https://www.ladydavis.ca/en/researcher/lars-grant/)**. I previously completed a BSc at **[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)** for which I received the **[First-Class Honours distinction](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/university_regulations_and_resources/undergraduate/gi_graduation_honours)** and the **[Dean’s Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research List Distinction](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/university_regulations_and_resources/undergraduate/gi_graduation_honours)**.

My two main research goals are:
- Improving how intelligent __agents__ learn and __make decisions__ in __complex environments__, especially when those environments involve __many possible actions__ and __sparse rewards__.
- Applying __AI__ to support __healthcare__ workers and patients in their decision making to __promote safety__, __robustness__ in __uncertain contexts__, and efficiency in __data-constrained environments__.
