Hi!
**[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/)**

My two main research goals are:
- Improving how intelligent __agents__ learn and __make decisions__ in __complex environments__, especially when those environments involve __many possible actions__ and __sparse rewards__.
- Applying __AI__ toÂ support __healthcare__ workers and patients in their decision making to __promote safety__, __robustness__ in __uncertain contexts__, and efficiency in __data-constrained environments__.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
