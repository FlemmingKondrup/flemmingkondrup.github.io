Hi! I am a PhD Student at McGill University and Mila with __[Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/)__ and Lars Grant at __[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/)__ and __[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)__.

__My two main research goals are:__
- __Improving how intelligent agents learn and make decisions in complex environments, especially when those environments involve many possible actions and sparse rewards.__
- __Applying AI to support healthcare workers and patients in their decision making to promote safety, robustness in uncertain contexts, and efficiency in data-constrained environments.__
