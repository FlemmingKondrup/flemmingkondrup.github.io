Hi! I am a PhD Student at McGill University and Mila with __[Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/)__ and Lars Grant at __[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/)__ and __[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)__.

My two main research goals are:
- Improving how intelligent __agents__ learn and __make decisions__ in __complex environments__, especially when those environments involve __many possible actions__ and __sparse rewards__.
- Applying __AI__ to support __healthcare__ workers and patients in their decision making to __promote safety__, __robustness__ in __uncertain contexts__, and efficiency in __data-constrained environments__.__
